//TODO: Change this component to a tweet view component. The tweet view component will have:
// 1. All the tweets tweeted by the users.  
// 2. A button to see our own respective profiles.
// 3. An input text field and a button to tweet.
// 4. (Optional) A feature using which a user can click on the name of another user (on his tweet), and can see his profile.
